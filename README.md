# api-testing-supertest-mocha-chai

Hey,

It's a simple project for API Testing using Supertest + Mocha + Chai. </br>
First of all, you have downloading/clone this project for your PC and to install all dependencies. Okay?

Do you have NODE installed? If not, you can know how to install in this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/</br>
It simplify your life for installing all dependencies with npm.

# Dependencies

* chai
* mocha
* supertest

# How to install

* git clone https://github.com/nathsilv/api-testing-supertest-mocha-chai.git </br>
* npm install

Now you have this project on your PC and all dependencies are installed. </br>
Let's understand  each file!

# FILE: package.json

In this file we have our signature and dependencies that project will need!
Once that you have all dependencies in this file you just need to execute: 'npm install' to install them.
This way is practice for exporting your project and you don't have a hard word for installing each dependency manually.

# FILE: api-testing.js

Here, we have all tests that we need for testing our api(POST, GET, PUT and DELETE).</br>
In this project i am testing a API that i have created and you can see here: https://github.com/nathsilv/api-node</br>
This api is about series and it is simple!</br>
For you test this project, you will need the API, so downloading that api-node project too! and Enjoy!

# How to run the tests?

First, up your API server(In my api-node project in my github i show how to up the server if you don't know it)</br>
Then, in the project directory execute: </br>
* npm test</br></br>

Simple, Isn't It?</br>

Any doubt you have, you can contact me and let's go to talk about it!</br>

You can be more than you think!
